# Known Issues & Technical Debt - AI-Indicator-Optimizer

## 📊 Project Status: 16/18 Tasks (88.9% Complete)

This document tracks known issues, technical debt, and optimization opportunities that should be addressed after core functionality is complete.

## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 1. Schema Mismatch in Parquet Logging (Task 16)
**Status:** Active Issue  
**Impact:** High - Prevents clean Parquet file appending  
**Root Cause:** Two different logging systems writing to same files with different schemas

**Problem Details:**
- `BarDatasetBuilder` generates columns like `feature_label_fwd_ret_h5` (Forward Return Labels)
- `IntegratedDatasetLogger` generates columns like `feature_sma_5` (Technical Indicators)
- Both systems attempt to write to same Parquet files causing schema conflicts

**Error Messages:**
```
unable to vstack, column names don't match: "feature_label_fwd_ret_h5" and "feature_sma_5"
unable to append to a DataFrame of width 37 with a DataFrame of width 46
```

**Proposed Solution:**
- Separate logging streams: `features.parquet` vs `ml_dataset.parquet`
- Implement unified schema definition with fixed column sets
- Add schema validation layer before Parquet writes

**Current Status:** Documented for post-completion optimization  
**Workaround:** Currently functional - data is processed correctly, only append operations fail  
**Performance Impact:** None - system processes 266 predictions at 88.6 bars/sec  
**Production Impact:** Low - separate files work correctly, only multi-stream append affected

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 2. MockBar Compatibility (Task 16 - RESOLVED)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Impact:** Medium - Testing and demo functionality  
**Solution:** Added `bar_type` attribute to MockBar class

### 3. Import Dependencies (Task 16 - RESOLVED)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Impact:** Medium - Runtime errors in feature extraction  
**Solution:** Added proper `numpy` imports in feature extraction methods

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY / OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### 4. Performance Optimization
**Status:** Future Enhancement  
**Impact:** Low - System already performs well (88+ bars/sec)

**Opportunities:**
- Buffer size optimization based on hardware capabilities
- Parallel processing for multiple instruments
- Memory pool allocation for high-frequency operations

### 5. Error Handling Enhancement
**Status:** Future Enhancement  
**Impact:** Low - Current error handling is functional

**Opportunities:**
- More granular error categorization
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### 6. Configuration Management
**Status:** Future Enhancement  
**Impact:** Low - Current config system works

**Opportunities:**
- Hot-reload configuration without restart
- Environment-specific config validation
- Configuration versioning and migration

---

## 📋 TECHNICAL DEBT

### 1. Code Duplication
**Areas:**
- Feature extraction logic duplicated between components
- Similar validation patterns across multiple modules
- Repeated error handling patterns

**Refactoring Opportunities:**
- Extract common feature extraction utilities
- Create shared validation framework
- Implement centralized error handling

### 2. Testing Coverage
**Current State:** Basic testing implemented  
**Gaps:**
- Integration tests for complete pipeline
- Performance regression tests
- Error scenario testing

### 3. Documentation
**Current State:** Good inline documentation  
**Gaps:**
- API documentation generation
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Deployment and operations guides

## 🔧 GROKS FEEDBACK IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### ✅ COMPLETED
- Smart-Flush-Agent with dynamic buffer management
- Memory-pressure detection and scaling warnings
- Vision-integration testing capabilities
- Performance benchmarking and validation
- Enhanced hardware monitoring

### 🟡 PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
- Schema consistency (functional but needs architectural improvement)
- Memory scaling optimization (monitoring in place, auto-scaling needs refinement)
